  "content": "Safe Arrival and Dismissal Policy and Procedures\nPurpose\nThis policy and the procedures within help support the safe arrival and dismissal of children receiving care at Central Montessori School. This policy will provide staff, students and volunteers with a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities for ensuring the safe arrival and dismissal of children receiving care, including what steps are to be taken when a child does not arrive at the childcare centre as expected, as well as steps to follow to ensure the safe dismissal of children. This policy is intended to fulfill the obligations set out under Ontario Regulation 137/15 for policies and procedures regarding the safe arrival and dismissal of children in care.\n\nPolicy\nGeneral\nCentral Montessori School will ensure that any child receiving child care is only released to the child's parent/guardian, or an individual that the parent/guardian has provided written authorization allowing the child care centre to release the child. Central Montessori School will only dismiss children into the care of their parent/guardian or another authorized individual. The centre will not release any children from care without supervision. When a child does not arrive in care as expected or is not picked up as expected, staff must follow the safe arrival and dismissal procedures set out below.\n\nPolicy Statements\nProcedure:\nChildren will only be released to adults who are permitted by the parents and listed on the child's file or if written consent has been provided.\n\nAccepting a child into care\nWhen accepting a child into care at the time of drop-off, program staff in the room must:\nGreet the parent/guardian and child.\nWhere the parent/guardian indicates that someone other than the child's parent/guardians will be picking up, the staff must confirm that the person is listed on the student pick-up list on the child's file or, where the individual is not listed, ask the parent/guardian to provide authorization for pick-up in writing (e.g., note or email).\nDocument the change in the pick-up procedure in the daily written record.\nSign the child in on the classroom attendance record.\n\nWhere a child has not arrived in care as expected\nWhere a child does not arrive at the Central Montessori School, and the parent/guardian has not communicated a change in drop-off (e.g., left a voice message or advised the closing staff at pick-up), the staff in the classroom must:\nInform the supervisor/designee. The staff must commence contacting the child's parent/guardian no later than 10:00 am, and leave a message if there is no response. If no response is received after/within 4 hours, the staff will report to the supervisor/designee.\nThe supervisor/designee will contact the emergency person listed on file.\nOnce the child's absence has been confirmed, program staff shall document the child's absence on the attendance record and any additional information about the child's absence in the daily written record.\n\nReleasing a child from care\nThe staff who is supervising the child at the time of pick-up shall only release the child to the child's parent/guardian or an individual that the parent/guardian has provided written authorization for. Where the staff does not know the individual picking up the child (i.e., parent/guardian or authorized individual), they must:\nConfirm with another staff member that the individual is the child's parent/guardian/authorized pick-up.\nWhere the above is not possible, ask the parent/guardian/authorized individual for photo identification and confirm the individual's identity against the information on the child's file or written authorization. A copy of the identification will be kept in the child's file.\n\nWhere a child has not been picked up as expected (before the centre closes)\nWhere a parent/guardian has communicated a specific time or time frame for pick-up and the child has not been picked up at that time, the staff/supervisor/designee will call the parent/guardian to advise that the child is still in care and has not been picked up.\nWhere staff is unable to reach the parent/guardian, staff must leave a message. If staff does not hear from the parent/guardian after 15 minutes, the emergency contact listed on the child's file will be contacted. Where an authorized individual is responsible for pick-up and their contact information is available, staff shall contact them to confirm pick-up or leave a voicemail.\nIf no response is received from the parent/guardian or authorized individual, staff shall wait until program close (6 pm) and then follow procedures under \"where a child has not been picked up and the program is closed\".\n\nWhere a child has not been picked up and the centre is closed\nWhere a parent/guardian or authorized individual was scheduled to pick up the child and has not arrived by 6 pm, staff shall ensure that the child is provided a snack and activity. One staff will stay with the child while another attempts to contact the parent/guardian to advise they are still in care.\nIf the staff is unable to reach the parent/guardian, they will proceed to call the authorized individual. If unsuccessful, they will then call the emergency contact listed in the child's file.\nWhere staff is unable to reach any parent/guardian or authorized individual (including emergency contacts) by 7 pm, staff shall contact the local Children's Aid Society (CAS) at 416-924-4646 and follow CAS direction.\n\nDismissing a child from care without supervision procedure\nStaff will only release children to the parent/guardian or other authorized adult. Under no circumstances will children be released to walk home alone.\n\nThe policy will be reviewed by the staff, students and volunteers before they begin their employment at CMS, and annually thereafter or at any time a revision occurs. A record of this review will be signed and dated by the person who participated and conducted the review. This record will be maintained for a minimum of 3 years.\n\nDate: Policy and Procedures Established: January 1, 2024\nDate: Policy and Procedures Updated: January 8, 2024",

  "content": "The Sleep Supervision Policy and Procedures (Toddler & Preschool)\nThe CMS Sleep Supervision Policy’s intent is to reduce the risk of harm or injury when children are sleeping. Parents/Guardians of children who regularly sleep at the center will be initially consulted with respect to their child’s sleeping arrangements, sleeping preferences, precautions and required accommodations at the time of enrollment and at any time changes might be required, such as during transitions between programs/room, or when changes are requested by parents. Special sleeping instruction will be recorded on a child’s application annually or as changes are required thereafter. Staff will be informed of a child’s sleeping arrangements by the office upon initial registration, annually thereafter, or when changes are requested or made. Significant changes in a child’s sleeping patterns or behaviours will be immediately communicated with parents as they arise verbally or through the daily communicable book.\n\nGeneral Procedures:\nChildren are assigned to individual cots labelled with the child’s name and class number/name to identify which children are present in the area or room.\n\nCots comply with the standards in the regulations made under the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act.\n\nParents will be consulted at the time of enrollment with respect to a child’s sleeping arrangements.\n\nThere must be sufficient light in the sleeping area or room to conduct direct visual checks of children through the use of lamps or leaving blinds open (as required).\n\nStaff must perform a direct visual check of all sleeping children every 30 minutes by being physically present beside the child while the child is sleeping and looking for indicators of distress or unusual behaviours such as: changes in the colour of the skin, breathing patterns, signs of overheating, etc. Staff will document the direct visual checks being conducted on every child’s sleep tracking sheet.\n\nThe observance of any significant changes in a child’s sleeping patterns or behaviours during sleep will be tracked and communicated to parents verbally. This might result in adjustments to the manner in which the child is supervised during sleep and details regarding the performance of direct visual checks and how frequently direct visual checks will be performed.\n\nSystem to identify the use of Sleep Room:\n\nStaff are required to record sleeping children’s name in their daily log book and ensure that the time of their return to the classroom is logged to ensure children are accounted for at all times, whether in the sleep room or in the classroom.\n\nThis policy will be reviewed by staff, students and volunteers before they begin their employment at CMS, and annually thereafter, or at any time a revision occurs. A record of this review will be signed and dated by the person who participated and conducted the review and will be kept for a minimum of 3 years.",

  "title": "Sleep Supervision Policy and Procedures (Infants)",
  "content":"The Sleep Supervision Policy and Procedures (Infants)\nThe purpose of this policy and procedures is to reduce the risk of harm and injury, including death, when infants are sleeping. CMS will ensure that children younger than 12 months of age are placed for sleep in a manner consistent with the recommendation as set out in the Public Health’s “Joint Statement on Safe Sleep: Preventing Sudden Infant Deaths in Canada.”\n\nNote: The current recommendation set out in the most current version of the Joint Statement on Safe Sleep: Preventing Sudden Infant Deaths in Canada is that children up to their first birthday be placed on their backs for sleep. This requirement can only be waived if a medical doctor/physician recommends otherwise in writing. Once infants are able to roll from their backs to their stomachs or sides, it is not necessary to reposition them onto their backs.\n\nProcedure:\nChildren are assigned to individual cribs labelled with their name and a picture card placed above their crib to immediately identify which children are present in the area or room.\n\nCribs comply with the standards in the regulations made under the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act. A document will be completed for each crib in the infant room and filed in a secure location with the make, model number and the year it was produced.\n\nAnnual checks will be conducted and documented to confirm that the cribs meet the standards as set out in the Public Health Agency of Canada’s Joint Statement on Safe Sleep. This document will be filed and maintained at CMS for three years.\n\nParents are consulted with respect to a child’s sleeping arrangement verbally at the time of enrollment, and at any time changes might be required, such as during transitions between programs/room, or when changes are requested by parents. Parents will also be advised that children 12 months and younger will be placed on their backs for sleep in accordance with the Joint Statement on Safe Sleep. CMS shall adhere to these recommendations unless a child’s physician recommends otherwise in writing regarding alternate sleep positions. This information is transferred to the “sleep card” placed over the child’s crib and reviewed by staff in the infant room.\n\nParents will be consulted before an infant is transitioned to the toddler room and will receive a consent letter to approve the transition of their child from an infant crib to a cot for nap time. This letter will be signed and dated by the parents and staff and placed in the child’s file.\n\nInfants are safest when placed to sleep in fitted one-piece sleepwear comfortable at room temperature to reduce the risk of overheating and minimize the use of blankets. If a blanket is used, it must be breathable. No extra items such as pillows, duvets, or bumper pads may be placed in the crib.\n\nThere must be sufficient light in the sleeping area or room to conduct direct visual checks of children through the use of lamps or leaving blinds open.\n\nStaff must perform a direct visual check of all sleeping children every 15 minutes by being physically present beside the child and looking for indicators of distress or unusual behaviours such as changes in skin colour, breathing patterns, or signs of overheating. Staff will document direct visual checks on each child’s sleep tracking sheet.\n\nThe observance of any significant changes in a child’s sleeping patterns or behaviours during sleep will be tracked and communicated to parents either verbally or through daily reports. This may result in adjustments to how the child is supervised during sleep and how frequently direct visual checks are performed.\n\nStrollers, swings, bouncers and car seats are not intended for infant sleep. An infant’s head can fall forward when sleeping in a seated position and cause airway constriction. Once an infant falls asleep, the child should be moved as soon as possible or once at the destination to sleep in a crib.\n\nSystem to identify the use of Sleep Room:\nStaff are required to place the name tag of children sleeping in the sleep room on the door or wall outside the room.\nWhen there are more than 3 infants in the sleep room, one staff member must be physically present inside the sleep room.\n\nElectronic Monitoring Devices:\nElectronic sleep monitoring devices are not used as a replacement for direct visual checks. Staff must still conduct checks according to regulations. Devices must be checked daily to ensure they are functioning properly. The time, date and condition of the device will be documented on the device tracking sheet.\nIf a device is not working, staff shall inform the supervisor for repair or removal.\n\nThis policy will be reviewed by staff, students and volunteers before they begin their employment at CMS, and annually thereafter, or at any time a revision occurs. A record of this review will be signed and dated by the person who participated and will be maintained for a minimum of 3 years in a secure location at CMS.\n\nRE: INFANT–TODDLER SLEEP TRANSITION\n\nCHILD’S NAME: _________________________    D.O.B.: __________________\n\nI, __________________________________, understand that my child is transitioning to the Toddler room and is using a toddler cot during nap time.

All of our policies and procedures are reviewed by staff, students and volunteers before they begin their employment or placement at CMS, annually thereafter, and at any time a revision occurs.\n\nOur Program Statement describes our aims for children and the approaches that we implement to meet these goals. In this document we will further cover the expectations of staff for each provision in ss.46 (3) (a-k) as set out under the Child Care and Early Years Act and Ontario regulation 137/15.\n\nPromoting the health, safety, nutrition and well-being of children (s.46 (3) (a))\nPROHIBITED PRACTICES\nCMS prohibits all types of physical punishment and other harmful disciplinary actions for the protection of the emotional and physical well-being of children.
